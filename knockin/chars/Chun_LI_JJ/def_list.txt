Chun-Li: Finally! Back home. it's been a long time since I left here.
Chun-Li: It's so strange, I have strong feeling \nthat I'm not belong to here:( \nWhy everything here is so unfamiliar.
Chun-Li: I need to find that guy ASAP.

Akiman: WOW, look who is there. How is it going my dear Chun-Li?
Chun-Li: Great but something is confusing me and I can't walk out from that shadow. And Only you can give me the right answer.
A: O? what's that?
Chun-Li: That's my surname? 
A: ... Is that really important? Everybody loves you that's enought
Chun-Li: It is important! You've designed my main story that is to revanage my farther's death but I even don't know my farther's name?
A: I'm sorry dear, but these were no design for your father like name or figure, so you don't have a surname officially. 
Chun-Li: Can I have one? and a designed father?
A: Sorry my dear, I still have lots of jobs to do and that takes efforts. CAPCOM won't gonna approve it.
Chun-Li: Why it's so complex.
A: This is how a big work. Sorry you are a out-dated character. They won't allow me the take more time on you.
Chun-Li: .......... [crying].....
